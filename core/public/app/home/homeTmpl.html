	<h1>Our Story</h1>
	<hr>
	<p>Wishing Forest was created by Laura and Jim Beagley.</p>
	<p>Laura has always loved and been inspired by stones, crystals, and nature..</p>
	<p>Her love of nature and trees seemed an awesome next step in creating pieces that she loves.</p>
	<p>Her one of a kind sculptures, windchimes, globes, suncatchers, jewelry, and more are inspired by trees and and nature as
		well as the love of the stones she used to construct them.</p>
	<p>Many of her pieces are created using stones from her native Utah which provides an wide variety of inspiration.</p>
	<p>Jim cuts and polishes each tree sculpture base and creates the support for each sculpture that she has made.</p>
	<p>He also creates many pieces of polished stone that she utilizes to create her wire wrapped jewelry.</p>
	<p>This husband and wife duo has found a love of creating and we hope that you enjoy the pieces that we create together</p>

	<h1>Tree of Life</h1>
	<hr>
	<p>The Tree of Life represents the cycle of Life and Death.</p>

	<p>When Clearing the fields the Celts always left a Tree of Life to bring unity, security, and integrity.</p>

	<p>The roots of the Tree of Life link us to Mother Earth and branches reach up towards Father Sky.</p>

	<p>The Tree of Life was planted by God in the Garden if Eden. It’s fruit gives everlasting life.</p>

	<p>Budha sat below the Bodhi (Tree of Life) roots hold the lower world of the Earth Spirits together, the trunk maintains the
		Middle World of Man, and it’s branches are the World of the Gods.</p>

	<p>Drawn from these and many more cultures the Tree of Life has come to universally represent Love, Wisdom, Rebirth, Renewal,
		Strength, Redemption, Friendship, Bounty, and Encouragement.</p>

	<p>With this Tree of Life may these blessings be yours.</p>
