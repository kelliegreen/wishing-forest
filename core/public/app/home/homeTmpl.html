	<h1>Our Story</h1>
	<hr>
	<p>Wishing Forest was created by Laura and Jim Beagley. Laura has always loved and been inspired by stones, crystals, and nature..
		Her love of nature and trees seemed an awesome next step in creating pieces that she loves. Her one of a kind sculptures,
		windchimes, globes, suncatchers, jewelry, and more are inspired by trees and and nature as well as the love of the stones
		she used to construct them. Many of her pieces are created using stones from her native Utah which provides an wide variety
		of inspiration. Jim cuts an polishes each tree sculpture base and creates the support for each sculpture that she has made.
		He also creates many pieces of polished stone that she utilizes to create her wire wrapped jewelry. This husband and wife
		duo has found a love of creating and we hope that you enjoy the pieces that we create together</p>
